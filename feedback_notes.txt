On exercise 3, I accidentally created a ViewController that was called movie and not movies. How do I remove it
since multiple files are generated via the rails generate controller command.
I may actually remove every single one by hand, but it would be nice if there is a command for that.
I don't as of writing this feedback and I have to search on google I guess.
